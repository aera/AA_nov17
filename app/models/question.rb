  # Like `belongs_to`, `has_many` tells Rails that Question is associated to the
  # Answer model.
  # It implies that the model where `has_many` is defined doesn't have the
  # the foreign_key (i.e. question_id) meaning that the `answers` has
  # the `question_id`.
  has_many :answers, dependent: :destroy
  # `dependent: :destroy` will cause all associated answers to be destroyed
  # when the associated is destroyed.

  # `dependent: :nullify` will cause all associated answers to no longuer
  # associated before a question is destrored. In other words, their
  # `question_id` column will be set to `NULL`.

  # We can define validations here that'll be checked before a model is saved
  # to the database. If any of the rules fail, ActiveRecord will prevent saving
  # it by doing a rollback and will also add error message to the model instance.
  # You can access these error message with the `error` method. You can
  # nicer print out of those message by using `error.full_messages`.
  # For example:
  # q = Question.new
  # q.save
  # q.errors.full_messages

  # You can also check if a model instance is valid without trying to save to the
  # database by using the method `valid?`

  # Note that it is not plural. Its first argument is a symbol that is the name
  # of a method inside of your model (whatever name you want).
  # This method will be run during the validation phase and if it adds
  # any error to the model instance it will fail the validation.
