<%# Partial templates are meant to be rendered inside other templates.
    In rails, we prefix templates that are meant to be used as partials
    with an `_`.
%>

<%# `form_for` is a helper method that expects you to give it an instance of a
    model as its first argument. From that instance, `form_for` will automatically
    pick the correct path to create appropriate `action`, fill in ids and classes
    based on the model's name, fill in input fields values based on the columns
    they represent, create for a new instance or editing and existing instance, etc.
%>

<%# `form_for` can determine if it should render a form as an edit or a new
    based on whether or not the model instance passed in is `.persisted?`.
    `.persisted?` is a method that returns true or false indicateing whether
    or not an instance is saved to the database.
